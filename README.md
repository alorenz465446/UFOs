# UFOs
Analysis of UFO sightings using Java

## Overview
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

The objective of this challenge is for you to create multiple search criteria in addition to the date filter you created in this module. When a user enters the search criteria the `app.js` will store the element, value, and the id of the filter that was changed and then filter the dataset and keep only the data that matches search criteria. The search criteria will will be rendered on the webapge.
