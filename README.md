# UFOs

## Overview
Creating a dynamic webpage to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Adding table filters for the date, city, state, country, and shape. When a user enters the search criteria the `app.js` will store the element, value, and the id of the filter that was changed and then filter the dataset and keep only the data that matches search criteria. The search criteria will will be rendered on the webapge.
