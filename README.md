# UFOs

## Overview
Creating a dynamic webpage to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Adding table filters for the date, city, state, country, and shape. When a user enters the search criteria the `app.js` will store the element, value, and the id of the filter that was changed and then filter the dataset and keep only the data that matches search criteria. The search criteria will will be rendered on the webapge. 


## How It Works

[Link to deployed webpage](https://alorenz465446.github.io/UFOs/)

To perform a search click on the link highlighted above. Once you have been directed to the webpage you can scroll down and see the filtered search section. Should look like the image provided below.

From there you can put in criteria to search using all the filters or just one to render your results. There are suggestions in the filters already presented but you can search whatever date, city, state, country, and shape you desire. 

For example purposes I am going to search for sighitngs in the state Arkansas. When entering the criteria in the filters, make sure it matches the id presented in the results or it will not register. So for the state Arkansas I will input 'ar' into the filter. Below is a picture of my results:
